            <h2>Iron Man: Unavailable, Tony Stark: In Trouble</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>After what happened in New York the Avengers with the help of Tony Stark are trying to become more independent. The team has grown together and for Steve Iron Man is a big part of that, although he has some trouble getting along with his employer. Then Steve faces a bit of a mystery when Tony Stark gets kidnapped â€“ and Iron Man, who is supposed to be the man's bodyguard when he's not an Avenger, is nowhere to be found.</p>
            <p>Reason: Iron man's identity isn't revealed in the end of the movie and now Tony is kidnapped, everyone coun't find Tony's bodyguard Iron man it's so funny.</p>
            <p>###</p>
            <h2>inside man</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>Steve realizes that Iron Man is a great source of inside-knowledge for his first date with Tony Stark!</p>
            <p>Reason: Iron man identity porn again (ps not real porn just a trope), light funny short fic where Steve tried to get to know Tony via Iron man.</p>
            <p>###</p>
            <h2>Substantial Code</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>What if Tony Stark died of Palladium poisoning during the events of Iron Man 2?</p>
            <p>Tony knew he was dying, and after giving away his company to Pepper and the War Machine suit to Rhodey, Tony gives away one more thing - the title of Iron Man.</p>
            <p>But the title doesn't pass to Rhodey like the silver suit. Instead, it, and a new type of suit, pass to the one who was closest to Tony, and who was often overlooked as Tony's true best friend: JARVIS.</p>
            <p>OR, how the MCU would be different if JARVIS took over as Iron Man.</p>
            <p>Reason: Alternative universe where JARVIS is Iron man.</p>
