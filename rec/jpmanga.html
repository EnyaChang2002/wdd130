            <h1>Ao3 Recommendation</h1>
            <h2>Sky's the Limit</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>When All Might tells Izuku that he can't be a hero without a Quirk, that's the last straw. Izuku indeed takes a swan dive off the roof, hoping for a swift death.</p>
            <p>Except--</p>
            <p>He doesn't hit the ground.</p>
            <p>He flies.</p>
            <p>Reason: This is about Izuku getting to be a bird.</p>
            <p>###</p>
            <h2>Float Like a Moth, Sting Like a Bee</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>Izuku Midoriya always knew he was going to be a hero. His quirk, Night Vision, might not be as flashy or powerful as some of the others in the business, but it was his, and he was going to use it to help others.</p>
            <p>When he was four, his world undergoes an unexpected metamorphosis.</p>
            <p>Reason: Izuku's quirk makes him have the traits of a moth. Cute friendship in the childhood instead of being bullied.</p>
            <p>###</p>
            <h2>Skip</h2>
            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>Aizawa Shouta was tired.</p>
            <p>Crouched on the edge of the roof as he was, he observed the streets below him silently. He was coming to the end of his patrol, and if everything remained as it was, he'd be able to catch a decent nap before having to report in to the school for another round of proctoring.</p>
            <p>Which, of course, is when he saw the kid being chased down the alley.</p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>Or Izuku is your average 21st-century kid. Being sucked through a time-traveling portal and dropped in the middle of a fantasy world with supervillains was not his idea for a good start to the new school year. Good thing he has everyone's favorite underground hero keeping an eye on him. With a hero by his side, how much trouble could he possibly get into while trying to find his way back home?</p>
            <p>Reason: Izuku as a accidental dimension traveler. His green hair is dyed, numerous humorous things happened. Quite light and finny in my opinion.</p>
